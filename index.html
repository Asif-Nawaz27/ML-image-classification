        <h1>Research Content</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The research main goal is to create an image classification system using machine learning to help with the diagnosis of various diseases, including pneumonia, cardiomegaly, emphysema, diffusion, mass, and other conditions that are scanned on chest X-rays. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized by the system to extract features, taking advantage of their capacity to capture spatial hierarchies of images by means of multiple convolutional and pooling layers. Using transfer learning, pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 are compared and optimized for best performance alongside CNN architecture.</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which classify tasks across multiple domains have been transformed. Convolutional neural networks have become the standard architecture in medical diagnosis because of their capacity to extract features from images. Multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations make up CNNs, which enable the network to recognize complex patterns of the images. Deep learning is especially useful for image recognition in ma-chine learning via different medium.</p>
        <p>This statement according by Igor kononenko [1] that is “Medical datasets were the initial source of design and application for machine learning algorithms. These days, machine learning offers a number of essential instruments for astute data analysis. The digital revolution has made it relatively cheap and accessible to gather and store data, especially in the last few years. Large information systems collect and share data, and modern hospitals are well-equipped with monitoring and other data collection tools. Medical data analysis is currently a good fit for machine learning technology, and in particular, a lot of work has been done in the area of medical diagnosis in small, specialized diagnostic problems.”</p>
        <p>Data preprocessing techniques, including image augmentation (rotation, scaling, flipping and colour adjustments) are applied to improve the robustness of the model. The model perfor-mance is evaluated using metrix like precision, f1-score, accuracy, recall, and confusion matrix, providing a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness. CNN-based methods have various strategies to increase the performance of image classification on datasets,[2] one method is using in project is data augmentation via imageDataGenerator with configurations. Convolution neural networks are obtained by stacking one or more computational layers, The traditional transform-based data augmentation has better performance than generative adversarial net-work and other neural network-based methods. However, there are certain things that should be noted. [2] A limitation of Kermany’s research is that use the InceptionV3 model which is stop retrain the convolutional layer of InceptionV3 because of the overfitting. Therefore, we are implementing effects of retraining the convolutional layers on these models (convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, ResNet50 and InceptionV3) will be evaluated in this project. An examination of how the CNN transfer method performed on the small chest X-ray dataset to determine how data augmentation, network complexity, fine-tuned convolutional layer, and other prevent overfitting mechanisms affected the classification.</p>
        <p>By integrating chest X-ray dataset, almost 11 million of X-ray images for multiple patients who have fourteen text-mined diseases image labels (where each image can have multiple labels). Atelectasis, Pneumothorax, Infiltration, Edema, Consolidation, Fibrosis, Emphysema, Effusion, Nodule, Pneumonia, Pleural thickening, Cardiomegaly, Mass, and Hernia are among the four-teen common diseases and all the models will be predicting multiple labels with data augmentation via the rotation range, scaling and other more configuration.</p>
        <p>Deep learning needs a huge amount of data to get better result. Especially on medical problem to get and annotate the data is very important and time-consuming process. There are some solutions to solve the problem, one already little bit discuss on above is data augmentation which is prevent the overfitting and improves the accuracy on training data and another method for boosting the performance of in deep learning particularly CNNs which is named as transfer learning. So, in this project we will be utilize data augmentation method.</p>
        <p>Here is the discussion on feature extraction using convolution, for all the models will be use IMAGE_SIZE variable (which represent the image pixels) which is [128,128] that will be used as input to standard feed-forward neural networks to solve image classification.</p>      

        <h3>1.1 Background and Context</h3>
        <p>In this project, utilizing machine learning model convolutional neural Networks (CNNs) and pre trained models such as (InceptionV3, VGG16 and ResNet50) imageNet weights, excluding the top layers typically involves various components like weights, include top and input shape.</p>
        <p>So, the study focuses on the use on convolutional neural networks, to improve image classification for chest X-ray used in medical diagnosis. CNNs is ability to precisely extract complex patterns and deep learning. This has helped to diagnosis the conditions like all the features. The research build data augmentation and deep learning to improve model performance, identify the challenges.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1.1 Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>For thoracic diseases to be effectively treated and patient outcomes to be improved, an early and accurate diagnosis is essential. The most widely used imaging technique for diagnosing diseases like Atelectasis, Consolidation, and Infiltration is a chest X-ray. Nevertheless, the inter-pretation of these images is difficult and frequently arbitrary, greatly depending on radiologists' experience. This may result in inconsistent diagnosis, particularly in settings with limited re-sources where skilled radiologists might not be available.</p>
        <p>Radiologists are under a lot of pressure due to the growing number of chest X-rays that require analysis, which increases the risk of diagnostic mistakes and delays. Furthermore, a lot of thoracic diseases share similar visual features and symptoms, making it challenging to differentiate between them just by manual interpretation. This intricacy highlights the requirement for an automated, trustworthy instrument that can help with the precise categorization of thoracic diseases.</p>
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can use chest X-ray images to automatically classify a variety of thoracic diseases. With just one image, the model will be trained to distinguish between different conditions and produce multi-label predictions. The model can potentially outperform conventional diagnostic techniques by learning to recognize patterns and anomalies linked to specific diseases by utilizing extensive datasets like ChestX-ray. The implementation of this model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce the work-load on radiologists, and improve the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1.2 Research Rationale</h3>
        <p>Is it possible to create a multi-label classification model using deep learning that can effectively identify and categorize various medical conditions from chest X-ray images, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy/precision and enhancing patient outcomes?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to create a deep learning model that can identify various medical conditions from chest X-ray images.</li>
            <li>To assess the suggested model's effectiveness in terms of recall, accuracy, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrices.</li>
            <li>to assess how well the suggested model performs in comparison to current CAD (computer-aided diagnosis technology) systems and radiologists.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Scope and Objectives</h3>
        <p>Develop a robust and accurate deep learning model to automatically classify medical diseases from chest X-ray images. The model should be able to detect multiple diseases from a single X-ray image, providing a reliable tool that can assist medically diagnosing conditions such as Ate-lectasis, Consolidation, Infiltration, Pneumothorax, and other Hernia.</p>
        <p>The robustness of the model refers to the ability to perform well across a variety of conditions, including noisy data, variation in image quality and different patient’s demographics. A model should generalize well to new, unseen data, mean it should make accurate predictions even on X-ray images that various from those in the training set. So, in medically diagnostics, precision is essential. To reduce false positives—identifying a disease when one is not present—and false negatives—failing to detect a disease when one is present the model needs to have high precision and recall rates.</p>
        <p>In this case, models are not predicting well due to the dataset, because (generating training and validation data using the image data generator with augmentation and fit that training and validation dataset on models each epochs going to be overfitting), are all models giving the low accuracy on different neuron layers as well as rest of the metrics is not having best results.</p>
        <p>Massive amounts of data are required for deep learning to produce dependable results. On the other hand, certain challenges might not have adequate data. Obtaining and annotating the data is an expensive and time-consuming operation, particularly for medical conditions. Thank-fully, there are a few ways to handle this issue. Among these is data augmentation, which increases accuracy and prevents overfitting [3]. The training time data augmentation strategy was applied in this work. Various augmentation techniques were employed, including shifting, zooming, flipping, and rotating at 32-degree angles. Some of images have labels which means having this disease and some have not label which is not any disease.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Image Augmentation Examples:</strong> The following three examples demonstrate the data augmentation techniques applied to chest X-ray images to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.

            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>For multi-disease detection from single X-ray image: this objective requires the models to han-dle cases where multiple diseases might be present simultaneously in a single X-ray image. For example, a patient could have Infiltration and Hernia, and model should correctly predict both conditions.</p>
        <p>The Scope of the project will primarily be utilizing chest X-ray dataset which is a large collection of X-ray images labelled with 14 various diseases and added extra column “FilePath” in dataset for append path of the images in that column based on the Image Index column. I’m exploring the dataset to understand its structure, labels distribution, and image characteristics. This include identifying missing data or inconsistencies with the dataset.</p>
        <p>Data Preprocessing: Splitting the dataset different training, validation and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation. Apply a variety of augmentation technique (like rotation, sample wise standard normalization, shear range, width & height shift range, horizontal & vertical flip brightness range, rescale and fill model) to enhance training dataset, improving the model ability to generalize to unseen data.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Achievements</h3>
        <p>We evaluated four models by using deep learning convolutional layers, as defined the architecture of all models step by step in methodology. The deep learning models having capable of accurately classifying multiple thoracic diseases from chest x-ray images. Models effectively addresses complex challenges such as multi label classification, class imbalance and the high dimensionality of medical images. Implemented techniques such as class weighting, data augmentation and sample weighting, which ensured that the model performed well cross both common and rare thoracic diseases.</p>
        <p>Performance of the models which is not well on training data because when we fit training dataset on model that is going overfit due to the dataset. The reason behind this for the identification of the label is 0 or 1. So, the most of the datapoint is 0 which mean no diseases at all, the datapoint is 1 mean have disease on that label. It could be the reason training data on the model is going to overfitting. Also is not evaluating well on unseen dataset.</p>
        <p>Thus, the best model with the highest accuracy among the four models is displayed overall in this project. Showing the results for that best model which is accuracy, recall, F1-score, preci-sion and classification report as well which showing the result for label support. As well as showing the confusion metrices for all predicted labels and at the end deploy that model for integration.</p>
       
        <h3>1.4 Overview of Research</h3>
        <p>This project evaluates the x-ray image dataset using machine learning models, which are briefly described in the project methodology section and already mentioned in the introduction. This dissertation focuses on using deep learning models to classify images. Focusing on multi-label classification, where a single image may have several associated disease labels—is crucial. The following are crucial steps: understanding the data, building a model with hyperparameter tuning, enhancing and visualizing the data, and evaluating the performance of the model. Therefore, augmentation with different configurations such as range rotation, shear range, flipping, and others is used to prevent overfitting on the models.</p>
        <p>I am writing this section for the overview of models. In this article, all predicted models adhered to the same format. Like how to construct the first method that searches for the optimal parameters across batches and epochs, another method searches for the optimal parameters across learning rate, initialization mode, activation for dense layers, and dropout rate for the optimizer. Thus, as I indicated, there are two ways to look for the ideal parameters for a given model. Prior to fitting the training data to the model, the best fit will be assigned to a particular model and that model will be predicted on unseen data. Subsequently, the model is fitted using training data, and a report on model history visualization is displayed. After fitting the model and displaying the Roc report for the same data before and after training, predict the model once more on unseen data. The same processes are then taken for the other models, until the best accuracy model is obtained. The classification report for that model is then displayed, along with the confusion metrics, before the model is saved and deployed for use.
